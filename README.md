# SearchGas

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.1.

This project consists of a web platform developed with Angular that allows users to locate gas stations near a given location, displaying detailed information on fuel prices and fuel types available. The platform integrates with a database, that was done with PostgreSQL and Nestjs, to provide data, and offers filters to search for gas stations by distance, price or fuel type. In addition, accessibility and privacy compliance are prioritised, ensuring that the platform is easy to use and secure for all users. The main objective is to facilitate access to transparent fuel information and promote the use of more sustainable options.
